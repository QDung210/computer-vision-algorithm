# Computer Vision Algorithms Collection

This repository serves as a personal archive for various computer vision algorithms that I have studied and implemented.

Some of the algorithms are written from scratch to better understand their core logic, while others utilize libraries such as OpenCV for practicality and performance.

## Notes

- This repository is for educational purposes.
- Some algorithms are implemented from scratch, others use OpenCV for brevity or performance.
- Folder names like lab6, lab7, and lab8 correspond to assignments or experiments from my class exercises.

Feel free to explore and learn with me!
